This is a small version of a game framework. This edition has been created to be available to the public before Ludum Dare 34 (December 2015).

Originally a part of a larger, uncompleted framework. Some strange remnants may linger (as for example partial support for multiple cameras in a scene).

The framework is mostly untested. Use at your own risk.
